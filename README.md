# Task descriptions:
1. Band Name Generator: This task teaches us how to take user input in Python and how to store it in variables.
2. Tip Calculator: This task teaches us how to work with different data types and how to perform basic math in Python.  
3. Tresure Island: This task teaches us how to use control flow (if/else) and logical operators in our programs. 
4. Rock Paper Scissors: This task teaches us how to work with lists and the random module by having us implement the rock/paper/scissors game.
5. Password Generator: This task teaches us how to work with for loops in order to access different list elements by having us create a random password generator.
6. Reebords Hurdles: This task teaches us how to use and incorporate while loops into our code so that Reeborg can jump over hurdles/escape a maze.
7. Hangman: This task solidifies all the knowledge we've gathered so far by having us create a hangman game. In order to do this, we need to know how to import python files into our current code and how to properly use while/for loops and if statements.
8. Caeser Cipher: This task teaches us how to define our own functions in Python by having us write our own Caeser cipher encryption/decryption program.
