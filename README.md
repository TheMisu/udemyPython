# Task descriptions:
1. Band Name Generator: This task teaches us how to take user input in Python and how to store it in variables.
2. Tip Calculator: This task teaches us how to work with different data types and how to perform basic math in Python.  
3. Tresure Island: This task teaches us how to use control flow (if/else) and logical operators in our programs. 
4. Rock Paper Scissors: This task teaches us how to work with lists and the random module by having us implement the rock/paper/scissors game.
5. Password Generator: This task teaches us how to work with for loops in order to access different list elements by having us create a random password generator.
6. Reebords Hurdles: This task teaches us how to use and incorporate while loops into our code so that Reeborg can jump over hurdles/escape a maze.
7. Hangman: This task solidifies all the knowledge we've gathered so far by having us create a hangman game. In order to do this, we need to know how to import python files into our current code and how to properly use while/for loops and if statements.
8. Caeser Cipher: This task teaches us how to define our own functions in Python by having us write our own Caeser cipher encryption/decryption program.
9. Blind Auction: This task teaches us how to use dictionaries in order to store data as key/value pairs by having us write a blind auction program.
10. Calculator: This task teaches us how to use return functions (and recursion) by having us build a basic calculator app.
11. Blackjack Project: This project solidifies the knowledge gathered so far (loops/lists/functions/dictionaries) by having us build a blackjack game.
12. Number Guessing Game: This project should teach us how to use global/local variables (seems like I only used local vars though).
14. Higher Lower Game: This project solidifies the knowledge we've gathered so far by having us build a (console output only) HigherLower game.
15. Coffee Machine: This task introduces the concept of OOP and asks us to build a coffee machine that can prepare drinks, give a report on its resources/profit, take inputted resources from the user and turn itself off.
